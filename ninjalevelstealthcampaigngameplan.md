**Creating a concise gameplan**

The user wants a clear, actionable gameplan. I'll summarize the key points in bullet form:

1. Set up domain-wide delegation with JWT service account.
2. Use Gmail API for sending emails with domain-wide delegation.
3. Embed LOI in the email body and add an unsubscribe link.
4. Check email reputation through tools like Google Postmaster and Litmus.
5. Keep it simple without automations or scheduling.

I’ll present it as a straightforward gameplan without extra information to keep it clear.

Thought for 4 seconds

Here’s your **all-in-one ninja-stealth gameplan**, boiled down to a single, actionable checklist:

---

## 🥷 1. Send “like a human” via Gmail API + DWD

* **Domain-Wide Delegation**: use your service account key to impersonate each employee (no UI hacks, no CAPTCHAs).
* **Raw RFC-2822 messages**: build true multipart/alternative payloads (plain-text + minimal HTML), inject your headers, base64-URL encode, and fire off via `gmail.users.messages.send`.

## 📝 2. Make the LOI the email body

* **Paste your 150-ish word LOI** directly into the body (e.g. as a styled HTML block or simple table).
* **No PDFs**, **no custom fonts**, **no embedded images**—just lean, readable text.

## 🔗 3. Unsubscribe is non-negotiable

* **List-Unsubscribe header** + one-click link or mailto in your footer.
* It doesn’t kill personalization—it’s literally one more merge field in your template.

## 📈 4. Monitor your sender reputation

* **Google Postmaster Tools**: track domain reputation, spam-rate (<0.1%), authentication failures, IP health.
* **DMARC reports**: get visibility on any spoofing or mis-sends.

## 🔍 5. Pre-flight tests (Litmus-style)

* **Seed-list testing**: send drafts to real Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo accounts and check where they land.
* **Mail-Tester** (free) or build your own: POST your message to a testing API that scores SPF, DKIM, blacklist checks, content-triggers.
* **Automate** this in CI: on every template change, run a quick test and block the deploy if Spam score > threshold.

## ⏱️ 6. Human-paced cadence + daily cap

* **8-hour window** (e.g. 9 am–5 pm local)
* **Jitter**: schedule sends at **4–7 min** random intervals (cron → jitter script)
* **Cap** at **80–100 emails/day per user**—stop sending when you hit it

## 🔐 7. Lock down email auth

* **SPF** TXT: `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`
* **DKIM**: publish your public key under `default._domainkey` and sign every mail
* **DMARC** TXT: `v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com; pct=100`

## 📊 8. Real-time feedback loops

* **Bounce & unsubscribe handling**: auto-suppress in your database so you never resend.
* **Engagement tracking**: log opens, replies, “moves to Primary” vs. Spam. If complaints > 0.1%, throttle immediately.
* **Dashboard**: show sends, errors, spam-rate, reputation scores for your admins.

**TL;DR:**

> Build a small service around the **Gmail API + DWD**, send **LOI in body**, include **List-Unsubscribe**, throttle to **80–100/day** with **4–7 min jitter** over **8 hrs**, and obsessively **monitor** deliverability via **Postmaster Tools**, **seed-list tests**, and **DMARC reports**.

That’s your ninja stealth, mime-mimicry, and “no-Spam-Dungeon” blueprint—all in one.
